<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 33 year old game developer and aspiring full stack web developer. I entered the game industry as a music composer and am now a co-founder of my indie studio Whispering Dreams Studios and the creative director of Pit of Vipers, a 2D Turn Based Tactical RPG set in a unique magical fantasy world influenced by the Byzantine Empire and the military technology of the 30 Years War.</p>
