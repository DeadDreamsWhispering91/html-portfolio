<h1>The Best Movies Acccording to William</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>Haunting performance by Joaquin Phoenix in a gritty, dark 1980s comic book setting</p>

<h3>LOTR Trilogy (Extended)</h3>
<p>What can I say? An unmirrored accomplishment in bringing a written fantasy world to life at a mindblowing scale. The props, costumes and CGI still look incredible more than 20 years later.</p>

<h3>The Sixth Sense</h3>
<p>This might seem like an odd choice to some but Haley-Joel Osmont, Toni Collette and Bruce Willis deliver unforgettable performances that put this supernatural thriller into a league of it's own.</p>
